THE ANIMAL (noun) in the internet made it SLOWLY_ (adverb)  impossible to get my homework done. Everything took ten times longer to upload. The wifi in our neighborhood was SLOW adjective) so I had to use this dinosaur like method to proceed. It became my last resort as all my data usage had been over used on my personal hotspot and I also had no home wifi.
	I believe the home WIFI_(noun) was out due to the storm as all of our _NEIGHBOURS__(noun) had experienced similar problems. Unfortunately the problem was not resolved as quickly as I had hoped. I had a true appreciation for FAST_______(adjective) internet after enduring through the turmoil of the super slow internet coupled with the anxiety of trying to _FINISH___ (verb) my home work.
